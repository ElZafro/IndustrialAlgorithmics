# IndustrialAlgorithmics

This is the implementation of several scheduling methods which are part of the course **Industrial Algorithmics** at Adam Mickiewicz University.
Every source file is independent of the others, and allows user input through the terminal as well as showing the final schedule.

I made them in an afternoon so naming conventions are quite wonky.
